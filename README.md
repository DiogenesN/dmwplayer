# DMW Player
A web-based HTML offline music player to play your local music right in your browser. It works in your browser completely offline and plays audio files. It saves the playback state and resumes it when you open the same folder again. It also shows you the last opened folder name.

# What you can do with DMW Player
   1. Browse your local music collection.
   2. Play your audio files.
   3. Display the artwork.

# Installation/Usage
   1. Simply right click on dmwplayer.html and open it with your favorite web browser (or drag and drop).
   2. Click on the 'Choose Files' button and select the folder that contains your music and click on Upload.
   3. Click on Upload again when the warning dialog appears and it will start playing automatically.
